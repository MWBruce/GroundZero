My plain so far is to make the following:
A chat window where people can discuss stocks.

As such a user can log into the application, chat to other users and look at particular stocks while chatting.

I plan on taking an object oriented approach with the following structure

Running sql, to start run command:
sudo service mysql start
mysql -u root -p < ./db/initialize_database.sql

mysqldump -u root -p userDatabase > userDatabase_backup.sql

mysql -u root -p userDatabase < userDatabase_backup.sql


g++ -shared -fPIC -o /lib/libexample.so test.cpp

source myenv/bin/activate

password will change and Ill try to make that system more secure towards the end of this project

make server use tcp to communicate with open windows

while data collection server uses udp and uses threads/processes to collect data

reader writer problem considerations

message queue and design patterns
